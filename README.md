About The Creation Of [Arthronol](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/90aa0ace-4a6c-4c3d-9b23-c927850fb1fa/page/bDKhD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dr. Macasadia, the mastermind behind Arthronol was distressed to see his mother in joint pain. She had to let go of all the activities she loved due to her knee swelling and immobile joints.

While regular treatments like cortisol injections were prescribed, Dr. Macasadia knew that such treatments are a facade. So he set up the DocShamac Health Institute where he employed experienced researchers from the field of physiotherapy.

This team spent days and months studying natural ingredients that can permanently heal joint pain. Soon enough, it was discovered that South Asian people had really strong joints and this was attributed to consuming super ingredients like turmeric.

So turmeric went on to become the key ingredient in Arthronol. Following this, a few more natural ingredients were tested and added to the mix so that the effect of turmeric can be amplified. Once these ingredients were selected and the ratio was determined, Arthronol came into being.

What Is The Working Mechanism Of Arthronol?
-------------------------------------------

The working mechanism of Arthronol is rather simple. All of the ingredients in the mix target inflammation around your joints. Older people suffer from knee swelling because a protein called interleukin begins to accumulate around the kneecaps.

This protein triggers an inflammatory response which further erodes the synovial fluid, causing pain and immobility. Turmeric and Boswellia work on this protein and try to dissolve it so that the fluid can retain its optimal functioning and the inflammation can be reduced.

Once interleukin is taken care of, the other ingredients try to get rid of the free radicals around the joints that cause oxidative stress and make movements painful. Then the supplement tries to train your body so that it does not store interleukin around the joints anymore.

What’s The Science Behind [Arthronol](https://sites.google.com/view/arthronol-joint-pain-relief/home)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Astudy aimed to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin in reducing pain and improving the quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The study was conducted in Iran and included 139 participants between the ages of 40 and 65 years. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups wherein the treatment group received 1500 mg of curcumin per day for four weeks for analysis.

The results of the study showed that the treatment group experienced significant reductions in pain compared to the control group. The curcumin group also showed improvements in physical function and quality of life.

Furthermore, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, researchers set out to determine the effectiveness of Boswellia serrata in treating osteoarthritis-related knee pain. The study included 60 participants with osteoarthritis of the knee who were randomly assigned to receive either Boswellia serrata extract or a placebo for eight weeks.

The results of the study showed that participants who received Boswellia serrata extract experienced a significant reduction in knee pain compared to those who received the placebo during the study.

Now that we know how the supplement works, let’s move on to the advertised health benefits of Arthronol.

### Guarantees Better Joint Mobility

As soon as you start taking the supplement, the natural ingredients in the mix try to encourage joint mobility by enhancing the functioning of the synovial fluid. For most people suffering from joint pain, the synovial fluid usually doesn’t work as it is expected to. Thankfully, Arthronol addresses this and helps the fluid provide a cushion to your joints.

### Reduces Joint Pain

When you suffer from deteriorating joint health, extreme pain is the most common symptom and it is attributed to inflammation. The herbal components in Arthronol tend to reduce this inflammation by removing toxins and other harmful substances so that you can enjoy pain-free movements.

### Prevents Further Joint Issues

Unlike most joint health supplements, Arthronol can ensure that your joint health is optimized in the near future. This is because the supplement helps the body to identify free radicals and interleukin molecules, both of which interfere with the synovial fluid’s functioning. With this benefit, you can enjoy healthier joints in the long run without worrying about a relapse.
